                                        <p>June 2029, Hazel comes to Martha’s Vineyard to visit her boyfriend Arthur. He gives her a tour that ends at a cave he and his friends used to play in. At noon on the summer solstice a shaft of light enters and illuminates a crystal. An island myth says that if two people in love stand before the crystal, the light will open a door into the infinite. A vortex opens; they are hurled from the cave, and after they wade ashore on South Beach they’re met by Joshua and Patience Mayhew who lived on the island during the Revolutionary War. They’re back in June of 1779!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>They’re mistaken for Arthur Mayhew Jr. who was coming from England after petitioning Parliament for payment of livestock taken by the British Army (this is based on an actual event). Arthur realizes that the “real” Arthur died in a shipwreck and never delivered the message and that no matter what he says he’s going to change history. However, at the island meeting, he tells them the truth: no money is coming. The islanders are outraged and vote to join the rebellion. Hazel notices that Joshua seems less than enthusiastic, and she wonders where his loyalties lie. He and Patience take Arthur and Hazel, and their daughter Faith (who is going to be their servant) to the farm in Cottage City they’ve been given. They realize they can’t go back until next June, and try to farm with the help of Ed Norton and his sons Phineas and Solomon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Arthur uses his technical knowledge to build them a simple clay pipe water system, which thoroughly amazes Faith, and worries Hazel that they could create a temporal paradox. She also faces a number of challenges, not the least of which is adjusting to being a second class citizen in a patriarchal society! She struggles with the school teacher, is outraged at Arthur going on a whale hunt, and spanks Phineas for trying to “force his attentions” on Faith. She earns Ed’s wrath, but manages to talk her way out of a similar punishment with his strap. Faith is impressed with her bravery.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When they meet Theodosia Mayhew from Chilmark, who is deaf, a congenital birth defect common there, Hazel finds their deaf society fascinating. They visit Chilmark and Aquinnah, and Faith gets her eyes opened about the natives. All of them learn a bit of MVSL (Martha’s Vineyard Sign Language, which existed as a language and influenced ASL), and the Sachem of the Wampanoag tells them of the island legends concerning Moshup, their chief deity.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>On their way home, they visit Edgar Towne and face a new challenge: an orphan girl, Abigail is about to be whipped for stealing. Thinking fast, Arthur suggests they take the girl in, which worries Hazel, but she agrees as she knows it’s the only way to save the girl from future pain. As an orphan, she has no one to care for her, and is essentially an outcast. In the coming weeks, Abby becomes a member of the family, and they discover that someone is stealing from them. Faith tells them it’s the Silent One, a mute boy who lives out by the tombs of the cemetery. When they catch him, Hazel realizes he’s autistic, and has a new task: helping Saul (he is able to tell them his name) to communicate and live with them. As summer turns to fall, they settle into something of a family life, and Hazel and Arthur truly fall in love.</p>
                                        <p>However, Arthur has been keeping a secret. Next April a regiment of British soldiers will massacre the entire population! As his love for Faith, Abby, Saul and the rest of the family grows, he resolves to do something. However, before he can tell Hazel, he goes on another whale hunt, and the ship sinks. Most of the crew drowns and it appears Arthur is among them, but he washes ashore on Naushon Island, and faces the daunting task of getting back to the island. Hazel, now alone and a widow, has rights under Colonial law, but she not only must survive, she has the children to consider. As a young healthy woman, she is highly prized, and will have suitors to contend with. She is left to wonder if Arthur is truly gone, what her future holds, and will she ever see home again.

                        Sitting back, he lightly held the reins, and just took it in. Around them were all the glories of nature and all Art wanted to do was absorb it, let it soak into every fiber of his being, and be one with it. This was the island as he always imagined it could be: peaceful and quiet, and populated by happy and friendly folk. No stench of gas and oil assailed his nose. Trees, tall and strong stretched as far as he could see, and there was no roar of chainsaws signaling their untimely demise. He desperately wanted to throw his arms out as if it might help him embrace the powers he felt swirling around him. Instead, he closed his eyes, inhaled the clear air as deep as he could, and let the stresses of life drain from his body. They were replaced by the (for lack of a better term) bio-energies ebbing and flowing about the carriage.

                                        Despite his eyes being closed, he almost felt as if he could see, and yet his vantage point wasn’t himself. In a very real sense, he was having an out of body experience. His legs extended down into the soft moist soil like roots. His arms and fingers stretched into the clear blue sky as if transformed into branches and leaves, and his heart and lungs seemed to cease functioning. He didn’t feel dead. No, far from it, his body was in tune with the rhythms of nature, breathing in and breathing out, and merging with the life around him.   
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “Arthur, is that the meeting house?” Hazel said.                    
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        He sat bolt upright, his eyes snapping open, and he felt a great sense of loss. He’d been rudely shoved back into his body, the connection severed, and he now felt like a freshman at a senior mixer: surrounded by people, yet totally alone. He well remembered going through that at college. Scanning the area, he saw a modest building sitting by the side of the road. Clearly not a home, it had an air of official-ness about it, but smaller than the hall in Edgar Towne, so it was probably the meeting hall. Besides, it was the only building around.   
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “That’s it,” he said, signaling the horses to turn. “Goodness, the journey seemed so brief.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Hazel shrugged. “Well, time flies when you’re having fun."            
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “Oh, that’s very good, Auntie. Did you come up with that saying?” 
                                        </p>

                                        “What?” she replied, turning slightly in her seat to look at the girl. “Um, no, I-I heard it somewhere.”

                        Time travel, historical dramas with strong female leads, and alternate history are three of my favorite subjects, and about a year ago, while watching the Outlander cable series, I was inspired to create my latest novel The Long Journey Home, and it took off. To be honest, there were aspects of that series that I found weak: the time travel mechanism seemed simplistic to me, and I didn’t like that the characters were trying to change history – especially as it was a major historic event that truly couldn’t be changed! It was like sci-fi movies I’d seen about the Kennedy assassination, Pearl Harbor, and even one about trying to kill President Charles de Gaulle of France. The latter was the book and movie The Day of the Jackal. Both were outstanding thrillers, and I thought about how the author and filmmaker managed to achieve that. After all, people reading the book and seeing the movie knew that the assassin failed. So, how do you make that kind of story compelling?

                                        The story focused on the cat and mouse game between the killer and the police, and saved the attempt on de Gaulle’s life for the end. By then, you’re so caught up in the story you’re on the edge of your seat wondering how it’s going to end.

                                        All these things got me to thinking, could I write a time travel story with a better plot line? Well, I could sure try! Coming up with the time travel mechanism was easy enough, and making sure that my main characters would be trapped in the past for a certain timeframe. Then I pondered what the main plot should encompass. Should I pull the old predetermination cliché where the characters are supposed to be there, where it’s their actions that cause the very event they're trying to prevent?

                                        I immediately got the old “been there, done that” feeling from so many other stories.

                                        What if I just ignored the whole issue of creating a temporal paradox and merely told a story of life in the era I chose to set the story? Naw, I immediately decided that was too wimpy! That’s when I made my decision. They would go for it and change history. Of course, there was always the question of degree. Would it be a little change, a big change, or maybe a bit of both?

                                        To find out, you’ll have to read the book. At over 82,000 words, it is one of my longest books, and yet they seem to zip right along as the story unfolds. My previous novels have generally been rather short on flowery descriptive text. I tended to keep things brief. With this novel, I made the conscious decision to go in another direction, and the reason came down to one word: location. Initially, I was going to set the story on a fictitious island, much as I did with my murder mystery – Murder on Gosnold Island – but, as I learned more and more about the real events that took place on the island during the war, I decided to set it there, and did as much research as possible to make it an accurate and entertaining tale.

                                        Martha’s Vineyard has played a pivotal role in my life, having spent every summer of my youth there. I’ve drawn on my knowledge of its history and culture to weave a story full of the rich aspects of island life during the Revolutionary War: the deaf people of Chilmark and the burning of the Liberty Pole to name only two. In a very real sense, the island is a character in the story. I’m also autistic, and thus was able to create an honest portrayal of a boy similarly afflicted. The key element to this book can be summed up in one word: passion. I truly wanted to tell this story! I love it, I love the characters and the setting, and I most especially love the events (both historically accurate and the ones I’ve created). This is a story I truly wanted to tell and share with others. As Hemmingway said: writing is easy, you put paper in a typewriter and then bleed all over it. Well, I like to think my “blood,” my passion is on these pages. I hope you will too.

                                        The story centers on a young couple – Arthur Mayhew, long-time resident of Martha’s Vineyard, and his girlfriend Hazel Lowe – going back in time and having to survive in a culture where they have no experience or understanding as to how to act or get by.
