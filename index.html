                                            June of 1779!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>They’re mistaken for Arthur Mayhew Jr. who was coming from England after petitioning
                                            Parliament for payment of livestock taken by the British Army (this is based
                                            on an actual event). Arthur realizes that the “real” Arthur died in a shipwreck
                                            and never delivered the message and that no matter what he says he’s going to
                                            change history. However, at the island meeting, he tells them the truth: no money
                                            is coming. The islanders are outraged and vote to join the rebellion. Hazel notices
                                            that Joshua seems less than enthusiastic, and she wonders where his loyalties
                                            lie. He and Patience take Arthur and Hazel, and their daughter Faith (who is
                                            going to be their servant) to the farm in Cottage City they’ve been given. They
                                            realize they can’t go back until next June, and try to farm with the help of
                                            Ed Norton and his sons Phineas and Solomon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Arthur uses his technical knowledge to build them a simple clay pipe water system,
                                            which thoroughly amazes Faith, and worries Hazel that they could create a temporal
                                            paradox. She also faces a number of challenges, not the least of which is adjusting
                                            to being a second class citizen in a patriarchal society! She struggles with
                                            the school teacher, is outraged at Arthur going on a whale hunt, and spanks Phineas
                                            for trying to “force his attentions” on Faith. She earns Ed’s wrath, but manages
                                            to talk her way out of a similar punishment with his strap. Faith is impressed
                                            with her bravery.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When they meet Theodosia Mayhew from Chilmark, who is deaf, a congenital birth defect
                                            common there, Hazel finds their deaf society fascinating. They visit Chilmark
                                            and Aquinnah, and Faith gets her eyes opened about the natives. All of them learn
                                            a bit of MVSL (Martha’s Vineyard Sign Language, which existed as a language and
                                            influenced ASL), and the Sachem of the Wampanoag tells them of the island legends
                                            concerning Moshup, their chief deity.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>On their way home, they visit Edgar Towne and face a new challenge: an orphan girl,
                                            Abigail is about to be whipped for stealing. Thinking fast, Arthur suggests they
                                            take the girl in, which worries Hazel, but she agrees as she knows it’s the only
                                            way to save the girl from future pain. As an orphan, she has no one to care for
                                            her, and is essentially an outcast. In the coming weeks, Abby becomes a member
                                            of the family, and they discover that someone is stealing from them. Faith tells
                                            them it’s the Silent One, a mute boy who lives out by the tombs of the cemetery.
                                            When they catch him, Hazel realizes he’s autistic, and has a new task: helping
                                            Saul (he is able to tell them his name) to communicate and live with them. As
                                            summer turns to fall, they settle into something of a family life, and Hazel
                                            and Arthur truly fall in love.</p>
                                        <p>However, Arthur has been keeping a secret. Next April a regiment of British soldiers
                                            will massacre the entire population! As his love for Faith, Abby, Saul and the
                                            rest of the family grows, he resolves to do something. However, before he can
                                            tell Hazel, he goes on another whale hunt, and the ship sinks. Most of the crew
                                            drowns and it appears Arthur is among them, but he washes ashore on Naushon Island,
                                            and faces the daunting task of getting back to the island. Hazel, now alone and
                                            a widow, has rights under Colonial law, but she not only must survive, she has
                                            the children to consider. As a young healthy woman, she is highly prized, and
                                            will have suitors to contend with. She is left to wonder if Arthur is truly gone,
                                            what her future holds, and will she ever see home again.

                            Sitting back, he lightly held the reins, and just took it in. Around them were all the glories of nature and all Art wanted
                            to do was absorb it, let it soak into every fiber of his being, and be one with it. This was
                            the island as he always imagined it could be: peaceful and quiet, and populated by happy and
                            friendly folk. No stench of gas and oil assailed his nose. Trees, tall and strong stretched as
                            far as he could see, and there was no roar of chainsaws signaling their untimely demise. He desperately
                            wanted to throw his arms out as if it might help him embrace the powers he felt swirling around
                            him. Instead, he closed his eyes, inhaled the clear air as deep as he could, and let the stresses
                            of life drain from his body. They were replaced by the (for lack of a better term) bio-energies

                                            Despite his eyes being closed, he almost felt as if he could see, and yet his vantage point wasn’t himself. In a very real
                                            sense, he was having an out of body experience. His legs extended down into the
                                            soft moist soil like roots. His arms and fingers stretched into the clear blue
                                            sky as if transformed into branches and leaves, and his heart and lungs seemed
                                            to cease functioning. He didn’t feel dead. No, far from it, his body was in tune
                                            with the rhythms of nature, breathing in and breathing out, and merging with
                                            the life around him.

                                        <p>
                                            “Arthur, is that the meeting house?” Hazel said.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            He sat bolt upright, his eyes snapping open, and he felt a great sense of loss. He’d been rudely shoved back into his body,
                                            the connection severed, and he now felt like a freshman at a senior mixer: surrounded
                                            by people, yet totally alone. He well remembered going through that at college.
                                            Scanning the area, he saw a modest building sitting by the side of the road.
                                            Clearly not a home, it had an air of official-ness about it, but smaller than
                                            the hall in Edgar Towne, so it was probably the meeting hall. Besides, it was
                                            the only building around.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “That’s it,” he said, signaling the horses to turn. “Goodness, the journey seemed so brief.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Hazel shrugged. “Well, time flies when you’re having fun."
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “Oh, that’s very good, Auntie. Did you come up with that saying?”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “What?” she replied, turning slightly in her seat to look at the girl. “Um, no, I-I heard it somewhere.”

                            a year ago, while watching the Outlander cable series, I was inspired to create my latest novel
                            The Long Journey Home, and it took off. To be honest, there were aspects of that series that
                            I found weak: the time travel mechanism seemed simplistic to me, and I didn’t like that the characters
                            were trying to change history – especially as it was a major historic event that truly couldn’t
                            be changed! It was like sci-fi movies I’d seen about the Kennedy assassination, Pearl Harbor,
                            and even one about trying to kill President Charles de Gaulle of France. The latter was the book
                            and movie The Day of the Jackal. Both were outstanding thrillers, and I thought about how the
                            author and filmmaker managed to achieve that. After all, people reading the book and seeing the
                            movie knew that the assassin failed. So, how do you make that kind of story compelling?

                                            By not making it about the assassination.

                                        <p>
                                            The story focused on the cat and mouse game between the killer and the police, and saved the attempt on de Gaulle’s life
                                            for the end. By then, you’re so caught up in the story you’re on the edge of
                                            your seat wondering how it’s going to end.

                                            All these things got me to thinking, could I write a time travel story with a better plot line? Well, I could sure try! Coming
                                            up with the time travel mechanism was easy enough, and making sure that my main
                                            characters would be trapped in the past for a certain timeframe. Then I pondered
                                            what the main plot should encompass. Should I pull the old predetermination cliché
                                            where the characters are supposed to be there, where it’s their actions that
                                            cause the very event they're trying to prevent?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I immediately got the old “been there, done that” feeling from so many other stories.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            What if I just ignored the whole issue of creating a temporal paradox and merely told a story of life in the era I chose
                                            to set the story? Naw, I immediately decided that was too wimpy! That’s when
                                            I made my decision. They would go for it and change history. Of course, there
                                            was always the question of degree. Would it be a little change, a big change,
                                            or maybe a bit of both?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To find out, you’ll have to read the book. At over 82,000 words, it is one of my longest books, and yet they seem to zip
                                            right along as the story unfolds. My previous novels have generally been rather
                                            short on flowery descriptive text. I tended to keep things brief. With this novel,
                                            I made the conscious decision to go in another direction, and the reason came
                                            down to one word: location. Initially, I was going to set the story on a fictitious
                                            island, much as I did with my murder mystery – Murder on Gosnold Island – but,
                                            as I learned more and more about the real events that took place on the island
                                            during the war, I decided to set it there, and did as much research as possible
                                            to make it an accurate and entertaining tale.
                                        </p>

                                            Martha’s Vineyard has played a pivotal role in my life, having spent every summer of my youth there. I’ve drawn on my knowledge
                                            of its history and culture to weave a story full of the rich aspects of island
                                            life during the Revolutionary War: the deaf people of Chilmark and the burning
                                            of the Liberty Pole to name only two. In a very real sense, the island is a character
                                            in the story. I’m also autistic, and thus was able to create an honest portrayal
                                            of a boy similarly afflicted. The key element to this book can be summed up in
                                            one word: passion. I truly wanted to tell this story! I love it, I love the characters
                                            and the setting, and I most especially love the events (both historically accurate
                                            and the ones I’ve created). This is a story I truly wanted to tell and share
                                            with others. As Hemmingway said: writing is easy, you put paper in a typewriter
                                            and then bleed all over it. Well, I like to think my “blood,” my passion is on
                                            these pages. I hope you will too.

                                            The story centers on a young couple – Arthur Mayhew, long-time resident of Martha’s Vineyard, and his girlfriend Hazel Lowe
                                            – going back in time and having to survive in a culture where they have no experience
                                            or understanding as to how to act or get by.

                                        <p>
                                            Born and raised in Arlington, Massachusetts, and the youngest of five boys, he’s the son of a New England father and Italian
                                            mother. This means he’s passionate, but he never shows it!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            He moved to Venice, Florida when his dad retired, and maintained his connection with Massachusetts by returning there to
                                            spend summers on Martha’s Vineyard Island. The place figures quite prominently
                                            in his life, which is why many of his stories involve islands. He spent every
                                            summer of his childhood and youth there, living in a cottage called The Cricket
                                            in the Campgrounds of Oak Bluffs, and later a small place up on East Chop. His
                                            times on the island were full of all the usual fun of childhood that is unique
                                            to that special place: jumping from the jetty at Town Beach, flying kites and
                                            sailing boats at Ocean Park – and going there to hear the band play and see the
                                            August Fireworks – feeding ducks and catching minnows at Sunset Lake, entering
                                            his drawings in the Children’s Art Festival at the Tabernacle, climbing the cliffs
                                            of Gay Head (yes, he’s old enough to remember being able to do that!), and watching
                                            the navy use No Man’s Land for target practice. There were rides on the Flying
                                            Horses to catch the brass ring, playing in the old concrete bunkers of South
                                            Beach (before they slipped into the sea), fireworks and seeing the “Yellow Submarine”
                                            in Edgartown, and – of course – the Agricultural Fair in West Tisbury.

                                            about his childhood on the island – everything from catching the brass ring at
                                            the Flying Horses to a very personal family memory connected with Darling’s Candy
